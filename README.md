This is an expenses management website created for the purpose of better handling all types of expenses.

It has:
- an expense list page which contains a description of the expense, the category it belongs to and the amount. Features:
  
  a) viewing a table of all expenses
  
  b) filtering the table based on the category and on amount interval (these filters can be used at the same time or individually) + apply/clear filters
  
  c) export the expense list in csv, xlsx, xml and docx formats while also taking the filters into consideration
  
- other sections such as add expense, add category and view categories - these ones are on a more basic level and are yet to be implemented.
